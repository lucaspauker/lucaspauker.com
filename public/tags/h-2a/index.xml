      <description>In this blog post, we will explain why H-2A is a crucial program that supports the livelihood of countless farmers and workers.
H-2A is a US government program that allows farmers to bring foreign seasonal agricultural labor to the US. In 2021, over 300,000 workers came to the US under this program and over 16,000 farms across the country used the program. The H-2A visa lets workers stay in the US for one year, but this can be extended for up to three years.</description>
