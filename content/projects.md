## Terracotta AI

[Terracotta](https://github.com/lucaspauker/terracotta_ai) is a platform for fine-tuning and evaluating large language models. With Terracotta, we make iterating on the LLM workflow quick and easy. Here are a few features that we have:

- Training: Users can upload a dataset and fine-tune different LLMs provided by OpenAI within minutes using our training dashboard.
- Qualitative evaluation: A playground for qualitatively comparing base models vs. fine-tuned models from OpenAI and Cohere.
- Quantitative evaluation: An evaluation tool that lets you run inference on a dataset with any model with a few clicks, and compare several models across different NLP metrics of your choice. We calculate relevant metrics depending on what kind of task you want to do.
