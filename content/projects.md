## Tonely

Train your ear. Feel the music. Experience musical pitch through touch where Apple Watch haptics meet ear training.

<a href="https://tonely.io" target="_blank">Tonely</a> is an ongoing research project exploring how haptic feedback might help people develop pitch recognition. It's part experiment, part tool, and part invitation. We're building in public.

What if you could feel a perfect fifth? What if your wrist could help train your ear? We're exploring these questions one pulse at a time through three simple steps: Listen to musical intervals and notes, Feel corresponding haptic patterns on your wrist, and Learn to build pitch recognition through touch and sound. No music theory knowledge required.

## Terracotta AI

<a href="https://github.com/lucaspauker/terracotta_ai" target="_blank">Terracotta</a> is a platform for fine-tuning and evaluating large language models. With Terracotta, we make iterating on the LLM workflow quick and easy. Here are a few features that we have:

- Training: Users can upload a dataset and fine-tune different LLMs provided by OpenAI within minutes using our training dashboard.
- Qualitative evaluation: A playground for qualitatively comparing base models vs. fine-tuned models from OpenAI and Cohere.
- Quantitative evaluation: An evaluation tool that lets you run inference on a dataset with any model with a few clicks, and compare several models across different NLP metrics of your choice. We calculate relevant metrics depending on what kind of task you want to do.
